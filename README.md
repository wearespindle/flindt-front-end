# Flind front end

A [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)-enabled front end for the Flindt feedback tool.

## Status

<href="https://travis-ci.org/wearespindle/flindt-front-end"><img src="https://api.travis-ci.org/wearespindle/flindt-front-end.svg?branch=master" alt="Build status" /></a>

Active / maintained.

## Running the front end

- Without Docker:

```txt
npm i
npm run start
```

- üê≥ Docker:

The command `docker-compose up` will setup a multi-stage build Docker-container.\
Inside is the front end statically build and served through nginx webserver.\
It can be reached via `htpp://localhost:3000`.

In both cases you also need to run the [database and backend Docker](https://github.com/wearespindle/flindt#docker-related)-containers for Flindt to work.

Live reload is currently not supported, but you know what they say:

*Loads of manual refreshing per day, keeps the arthritis away!*
