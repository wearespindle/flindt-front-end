#Getting Started#

Webpack enabled frontend

####To run the frontend without Docker#####
You're able to run the frontend without Docker but remember to still run the backend docker for this to work.

```
	> cd frontend
	> npm i
	> npm run start
```

Livereload is currently not supported, but you know what they say:

`Loads of manual refreshing per day, keeps the arthritis away!`

Your frontend can be reached via `localhost:3000`.
