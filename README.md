# Getting Started

Webpack enabled front end

## Run the frontend without Docker

You're able to run the front end without Docker but remember to still run the backend docker for this to work.

```
	> npm i
	> npm run start
```

Live reload is currently not supported, but you know what they say:

*Loads of manual refreshing per day, keeps the arthritis away!*

Your front end can be reached via `localhost:3000`.
