# Getting Started

A [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)-enabled front end for the Flindt feedback tool.

## Run the front end

You're able to run the front end without Docker.\
But remember to still run the [backend Docker](https://github.com/wearespindle/flindt#docker-related) for this to work.

```txt
npm i
npm run start
```

Live reload is currently not supported, but you know what they say:

*Loads of manual refreshing per day, keeps the arthritis away!*

Your front end can be reached via `localhost:3000`.
